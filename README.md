# End-to-End Encrypted SignalR Chat Application (kIRC)

End-to-End Encrypted  SignalR Chat Application (kIRC) is a chat socket application that provides end-to-end encryption for secure messaging. Developed using SignalR, it ensures that messages are securely transmitted and can only be decrypted by the intended recipients.

## Purpose

The purpose of End-to-End Encrypted  SignalR Chat Application (kIRC) is to enable users to communicate securely. By offering end-to-end encryption, it creates a communication environment where messages can only be read by the sender and the recipient. This solution aims to preserve the privacy and integrity of user data by preventing unauthorized access or tampering by third parties.

## How It Works

End-to-End Encrypted  SignalR Chat Application (kIRC) follows the following basic steps to facilitate encrypted messaging between users:

1. Users generate a public-private key pair upon login. The public key is used to encrypt messages with other users, while the private key enables users to decrypt messages.

2. When a user wants to send a message, they encrypt the message using their private key and the recipient's public key, creating an encrypted message that can only be decrypted with the recipient's private key.

3. The encrypted message is transmitted to the recipient via the SignalR socket. The recipient decrypts the message using their private key and views its contents.

This process ensures end-to-end encryption of messages, creating a secure and confidential communication environment.
